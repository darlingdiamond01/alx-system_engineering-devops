Outage Postmortem: Web Stack Service Interruption.

Issue Summary: Duration: May 5, 2024, 10:30 AM to May 6, 2024, 2:45 AM (UTC+1) Impact: The web stack service experienced a complete outage, resulting in unavailability of all web services. Users were unable to access the website, API endpoints, and other related services. Approximately 85% of our user base was affected by this incident.

Timeline: 10:30 AM: The issue was detected when the monitoring system triggered multiple alerts for high error rates and a sudden drop in response time.

Actions Taken:

Investigation started by the on-call engineer, focusing on the web servers and application components.
Assumption made that a recent deployment might have caused the issue, leading to an immediate rollback of the latest code changes.
Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths:

Initially, the investigation focused on the database servers due to a recent schema migration. However, further analysis revealed no correlation between the migration and the outage.
Another debugging path explored was a suspected DDoS attack, but network traffic analysis confirmed normal patterns.
Escalation:

Incident was escalated to the DevOps team and senior engineering management due to thr prolonged duration and impact on users.
Collaborative efforts with the infrastructure team were initiated to investigate underlying infrastructure issues.
Incident Resolution:

The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, causing a disruption in traffic distribution to the web servers.
Load balancer configuration was corrected, and services were gradually restored.
By 2:45 AM, all web stack services were fully operational.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:

The load balancer misconfiguration led to an imbalance in traffic distribution, causing a bottleneck and subsequent service interruption.
Resolution:

Load balancer settings were carefully reviewed and adjusted to evenly distribute incoming requests across the web servers.
Additional monitoring checks were implemented to detect any future deviations in load balancer behaviour.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements:

Strengthen load balancing configuration management processes to avoid misconfigurations.
Enhance monitoring capabilities to proactively identify load balancer anomalies and traffic distribution issues.
Implement redundancy measures to mitigate the impact of single points of failure.
Tasks:

Conduct a comprehensive review of load balancer configurations across all environments.
Enhance load balancer monitoring to detect and alert on traffic distribution imbalances.
Establish automated deployment pipelines to ensure consistent load balancer configuration across deployments.
Perform regular load testing to validate load balancing capacity and effectiveness.
Conduct a post-incident review with the DevOps and Infrastructure teams to share lessons learned and improve incident response processes.
This postmortem provides an overview of the web stack service outage that occurred on May 5, 2024. By identifying the root cause and implementing corrective measures, we aim to prevent similar incidents in the future and ensure a more resilient web infrastructure.

Outage Postmortem: Web Stack Service Interruption - Unveiling the Mystery of the Vanishing Website.

Issue Summary: Duration: May 5, 2024, 10:30 AM to May 6, 2024, 2:45 AM (UTC+1) Impact: The web stack service experienced a complete outage, leaving users in a state of bewilderment and frustration. The webiste vanished into thin air, much like a magician's disappearing act, leaving approximately 85% of our users scratching their heads.

Timeline: 10:30 AM: Abracadabra! The issue was detected as our monitoring system went abuzz with alarms, indicating a surge in error rates and a sudden drop in response time. The magic trick had gone wrong!

Action Taken:

Our talented on-call engineer took the center stage, investigation the mischievous web servers and unraveling the secrets of the application components.
Suspecting a spell cast by a rogue deployment, we performed an emergency rollback of the latest code changes, hoping to undo the magic trick that cuased the outage.
Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths:

Like a magician's misdirection, our investigation initially focused on the database servers, suspecting a vanishing act due to a recent schema migration. But alas, it turned out to be just an illusion.
Another wild theory emerged, suggested a DDoS attack had pulled the website into a parallel dimension. However, our network traffic analysis revealed no signs of a magical assault.
Escalation:

As the applause turned into murmurs of concern, we raised the curtain and brought in the DevOps team and senior engineering wizards and witches to join our magical quest for answers.
The grand finale was an alliance with the all-knowing Infrastructure team, combining our powers to uncover the hidden secrets of the web stack.
Incident Resolution:

Our enchanted journey led us to a mischievous culprit--a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings. It had been playing tricks, disrupting the flow of traffic and causing the grand disappearance.
With a wave of our wands, we promptly corrected the load balancer's incantations, gradually resurrecting the website and restoring the magic to our users.
By 2:45 AM, the audience erupted in applause as the website reappeared, leaving them in awe of our mystical resurrection.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:

The vanishing act was orchestrated by a mischievous load balancer, who, with a misconfiguration, created an imbalance in traffic distribution, rendering the website invisible to all mortals.
Resolution:

Armed with our magic spells and debugging prowess, we meticulously adjusted the load balancer settings to restore balance to the force. The website emerged from the shadows, captivating the audience once again.
To prevent future magical mishaps, we fortified our monitoring enchantments ensuring we are alerted to any future attempts by the load balancer to dabble in the dark arts.
Corrective and Preventive Measures:

Improvements:

Strengthen our magical load balancer configuration practices to prevent further magical misconfigurations.
Enhance our mystical monitoring capabilities to detect any anomalies in the load balancer's behaviour and thwart its mischievous intentions.
Fortify our infrastructure with redundant enchantments to safeguard against single points of failure.
Tasks:

Configure a comprehensive review of the load balancer configurations across all realms.
Enhant our monitoring spells to detect and alert us to any imbalances in the magical traffic distribution.
Weave automated deployment spells to ensure consistent load balancer configuration across all magical deployments.
Perform regular magical load testing to validate the potency and effectiveness of our balancing spells.
Convene a council of wizards and witches from the DevOps and Infrastructure teams for a post-incident review, sharing our magical learnings and strengthening our incident response processes.
This postmortem takes you on a magical journey through the web stack service outage, where the website disappeared and reappeared like an illusion. By unraveling the secrets, dispelling misconfigurations, and fortifying our magic, we strive to ensure future performances that captivate our audience without any unexpected vanishing acts.
